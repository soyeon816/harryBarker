                    <b>Last updated: 1/12/2023</b>
                    <p>Harry Barker (hereinafter, “We,” “Us,” “Our”) is offering a mobile message service (the
                        "Service"). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to our terms and conditions
                        (“Mobile Terms”).</p>
                    <p>We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. We may also modify
                        these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective
                        date of any
                        such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>
                    <p>We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated
                        with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message and data rates may apply.</p>
                    <p>The Service allows Users to receive SMS/MMS mobile messages by affirmatively opting into the
                        Service, such as through online or application-based enrollment forms. Regardless of the opt-in
                        method
                        you utilized to join the Service, you agree that these Mobile Terms apply to your participation
                        in the Service. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other
                        technology. Your consent to receive autodialed marketing text messages is not required as a
                        condition of purchasing any goods or services. If you have opted in, the Service provides
                        updates, alerts,
                        information, promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders) from Harry
                        Barker via text messages through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided.
                        Message
                        frequency varies. Text the single keyword command STOP to 1(833) 253-2952 to cancel at any time.
                        You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text message. You understand and agree that the
                        foregoing options are the only reasonable methods of opting out. You also understand and agree
                        that any other method of opting out, including, but not limited to, texting words other than
                        those set
                        forth above or verbally requesting one of our employees to remove you from our list, is not a
                        reasonable means of opting out.</p>
                    <p>If you have subscribed to other Harry Barker mobile message programs and wish to cancel, you will
                        need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their
                        respective mobile terms. For Service support or assistance, text HELP to 1(833) 253-2952 or
                        email info@harrybarker.com.</p>
                    <p>We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and
                        will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP
                        requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and
                        we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.</p>
                    <p>The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered
                        messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. You agree to maintain accurate,
                        complete, and
                        up-to-date information with us related to your receipt of messages, including, without
                        limitation, notifying us immediately if you change your mobile number.</p>
                    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any third-party claims, liability,
                        damages or costs arising from your use of the Service or from you providing us with a phone
                        number that is
                        not your own.</p>
                    <p>You may not use or engage with the Service if you are under thirteen (13) years of age. If you
                        use or engage with the Service and are between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18) years
                        of age,
                        you must have your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission to do so. By using or engaging with
                        the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you are not under the age of thirteen (13) years,
                        are

                        permission to use or engage with the Service, or are of adult age in your jurisdiction. By using
                        or engaging
                        with the Service, you also acknowledge and agree that you are permitted by your jurisdiction’s
                        Applicable Law to use and/or engage with the Service.</p>
                    <p>You agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any
                        information sent through the text message service, any errors in such information, and/or any
                        action you may or may
                        not take in reliance on the information or text message service.</p>
